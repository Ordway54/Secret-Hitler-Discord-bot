# Secret Hitler Discord bot
## Overview
A Discord chat bot application that facilitates the playing of *Secret Hitler* entirely within the Discord client.

## About the Game
*Secret Hitler* is a social role deduction board game for 5-10 players about finding and stopping Hitler and a fascist takeover.

Players are secretly divided into two teams: the liberals, who have a majority, and the fascists, who are hidden to everyone but each other. If the liberals can learn to trust each other, they have enough votes to control the elections and save the day. But the fascists will say whatever it takes to get elected, advance their agenda, and win the game.

To learn more about the game itself, see [its official website](https://www.secrethitler.com/).

> For those unacquainted with the game, the use of "Hitler" and themes relating to fascism are for a historical and contextual backdrop only. *Secret Hitler* is in no way an endorsement of, or commentary on, any political party, figure, or ideology.
